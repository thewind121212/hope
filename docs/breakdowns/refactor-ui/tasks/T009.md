# T009 — FE: Bookmark List + Page Wiring

## Business Summary
Compose toolbar, list, and dialogs into the final user experience.

## Logic
Replace existing list/search wiring with the new toolbar and dialogs.

## Technical Logic
- Use toolbar-derived filters and sort.
- Wire add/edit modal and delete sheet.
- Ensure empty states are used consistently.

## Testing
Manual verification only: search, empty state, edit/delete flows.

## State
pending
