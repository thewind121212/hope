# T001 — FE: App Shell & Layout Refresh

## Business Summary
Give the app a polished, product-like shell with consistent layout and spacing.

## Logic
Update layout and top-level page structure to host the new toolbar, list, and modal triggers while removing any debug-only UI.

## Technical Logic
- Refactor `app/layout.tsx` for header + container with rose accent styling.
- Update `app/page.tsx` to use new feature modules and providers.
- Ensure responsive spacing at 375px and desktop widths.

## Testing
Manual verification only: check layout at 375px and desktop.

## State

## Files
- app/layout.tsx
