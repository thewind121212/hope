# T003: Create ThemeScript Component

## State: `pending`

## Action
Create `components/theme/ThemeScript.tsx` — an inline script that runs before React hydration.

## Business Summary
Prevents "flash of wrong theme" on page load. Users see the correct theme immediately, not a brief flash of light mode before dark kicks in.

## Logic
- Render a `<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML>` that:
  1. Reads `localStorage.getItem('bookmark-vault-theme')`
  2. Resolves to `'light'` or `'dark'` (system uses `matchMedia`)
  3. Adds/removes `dark` class on `document.documentElement`
- Must be placed in `<head>` or early in `<body>` before any visible content

## Technical Logic
```tsx
const themeScript = `
(function() {
  const stored = localStorage.getItem('bookmark-vault-theme');
  const prefersDark = window.matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)').matches;
  const theme = stored === 'dark' || (stored === 'system' || !stored) && prefersDark ? 'dark' : 'light';
  if (theme === 'dark') document.documentElement.classList.add('dark');
})();
`;
```

## Testing
Manual: Clear localStorage, reload page with OS in dark mode → should render dark immediately without flash.

## Patterns
This is a server component (no `"use client"`) since it only outputs static HTML.
