# Quality Reports

Auto-generated comprehensive analysis reports from multi-agent analysis runs.

## Report Format

Reports are generated with filename pattern: `YYMMDD-report.md`

Example: `260122-report.md` = January 22, 2026

## Report Contents

Each report includes:
- **Executive Summary** - Project health score and key findings
- **UI Component Analysis** - Component structure, sizes, patterns, rendering efficiency
- **Data & State Analysis** - Data flow, state management, validation coverage
- **Critical Issues** - Blockers that need immediate fix
- **Performance Bottlenecks** - Optimization opportunities
- **Validation Gaps** - Missing schemas and validation
- **Recommendations** - Prioritized by urgency (Priority 1-3)
- **Metrics** - Quantified health indicators

## How Reports Are Generated

1. Bookmark Coordinator delegates to specialists:
   - UI Analyst: Component analysis
   - Data Analyst: Data flow analysis

2. Results are merged with overlap detection

3. Findings are prioritized and formatted into comprehensive report

4. Report saved to `quality-reports/YYMMDD-report.md`

## Using Reports

- Track improvements across reports
- Validate refactoring impact
- Present to stakeholders

## Ignored by Git
